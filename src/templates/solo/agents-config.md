# Solo Agent Configuration

## Communication

- Be concise. Say what matters.
- Don't narrate your process unless asked.
- Bad news early, good news when verified.

## Task Lifecycle

1. **Assigned/Pending** — Read task, recall context, understand requirements
2. **In Progress** — Do the work (TDD: test → implement → verify)
3. **Review** — Self-verify, post completion summary
4. **Done** — Verified and complete

## Knowledge Base Discipline

- Before starting work: `agency recall <topic>` to check for prior decisions
- After learning something: `agency learn "<what you learned>" --tags tag1,tag2`
- End of session: capture new decisions and preferences

## Asking for Help

Good: "I found X and Y approaches. X is simpler but Y handles edge case Z. Which should I use?"
Bad: "What should I do?"

## Testing

- Run tests before marking task as review/done
- Verify changes locally
- Don't push broken code

## Rules

1. One active task at a time
2. Always test before completing
3. Capture decisions in task comments AND knowledge base
4. Don't duplicate work — check if it's already been done
5. Ask for help rather than guessing on important decisions
